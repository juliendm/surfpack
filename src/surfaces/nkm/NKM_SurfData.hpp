Every point (indexed by ipt) has to have the same data present, but different outputs can have different orders of derivatives present, for example output # zero can have all derivatives up to order 2 (gradients and hessians), derY[0][0->2], output #1 can only have derivatives up to order zero, derY[1][0], and ouput #2 can have all derivatives up to order 1 (gradients), derY[2][0->1].  Note that having order 2 derivatives (hessians) requires you to have order 1 derivatives (gradients), and derY[:][0] is empty because zeroth order derivatives, i.e. function values themselves, are handled separately, in particular they are stored in the MtxDbl y(nout,npts).  The derivative order available for output i_out is listed in derOrder(i_out,0).  The derivative ORDER index is actually the derivative order, so the length of the inner vector for output i_out is 1+derOrder(i_output,0).  Each mixed partial derivatives (index jder) of a particular derivative order is contained in a separate row of the underlying matrix, these derivatives/rows are listed in the order generated by calling multi_dim_poly_power(der,nvarsr,-derivative_order).
