% I like to put boxes around all of my figures and algorithms in
% reports, and finally came up with my 'bigbox' environment.  It makes
% a
% box as wide as the current text and sets the stuff inside with a
% narrower width.  The contents of 'bigbox.sty' are below.
%
% USAGE:
%
% \begin{figure}        (or {table}, or {center}, or ...)
%   \begin{bigbox}
%     \begin{tabbing}
%       ...
%     \end{tabbing}
%   \end{bigbox}
%   \caption{XXX}
% \end{figure}
